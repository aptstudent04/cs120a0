<h3>On Travel:</h3>
<p>Well, I've never been to Spain, but I've been to Oklahoma. They say the weather is insane there, but they don't know how to use it. It's Oklahoma, not Arizona, ... so you probably can't get ninety-nine cent Iced Tea.</p>

<h3> On Pet Names:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Luciano Pawvarotti - Hound</li>
	<li>The Worst - Chihuahua</li>
	<li>Bandit - Racoon</li>
</ul>

<h3>On Restauranting:</h3>
<p>Can't decide whether you want Indian or American Diner food? Go to <a href="https://www.tambersrestaurant.com/" target="new">Tambers</a>! Their milkshakes are on the small side but don't let that stop you.</p>

<h3>On Food:</h3>

<p>Bananas are one of the most a-peeling foods. In addition to an amenable texture and a flavor that can be blended easily, they come in their own wrapper! Importantly, this text also comes with a wrapper and does so to the right of the image.</p>

	<td>Perl is like a Swiss Army Knife. There's almost certainly a better tool for what you're trying to do, but if you know Perl you're going to try to do it in Perl before you go digging for something else.</td>

	<td>Robbins, Arnold</td>
	<td>If you can't open lynx to read the docs on vi because you only have one TTY and you don't want to quit the editor and lose your file chain, it's helpful to have a pocket reference.</td>

	<td>Neuburg, Matt</td>
	<td>PowerShell is like AppleScript for Windows. It doesn't do a lot on its own, but you can use it to tell various other system components to do useful things, which can save time from repetitive tasks like telling that one person how to do the thing, again. Just script it. Everyone wins!</td>

	<td>sed &amp; awk</td>

	<td>Dougherty, Dale and Robbins, Arnold</td>
	<td>sed and awk are two very powerful tools for text editing, but beware! Extended use of the stream editor may lead to frustration when using graphical editors, and Outlook doesn't support vim keybindings!</td>
